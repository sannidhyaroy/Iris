## **Features**
- **Bangs** : Iris supports bangs, which are special characters that act as shortcuts to the web. They work in a similar way as DuckDuckGo Bangs. By using a bang, you can search a website directly without having to visit it first. For example, if your search query contains a `!g` bang, Iris will automatically search for your query on Google. Similarly, if you use `!yt`, you're actually searching videos on YouTube. You can view the list of supported bangs on the [about page](https://iris.noton.tk/about).

- **Tags** : Iris supports tags which work together with bangs. Tags are attached as the suffix of the bang and they act as search type for the bang. For example, a `.i` tag denotes that you're searching for images. Hence ,if we include a `!g.i` along with our search query, Iris will redirect you to Google and search for images for that particular query. Similarly, `!g.v` will redirect you to Google and search for videos as `.v` tag means the search type will be for videos. Tags are a unique feature in Iris which take the flexibility of bangs to another level.

- **Multiple search engines** : Iris isn't a search engine in itself, but rather a tool which lets you enjoy the beauty of all other search engines in one place. You can choose your preferred search engine from the list of supported search engines and Iris will automatically redirect your query to the selected search engine by default when bangs aren't specified. This lets you use your favourite search engine without missing out on features like bangs or tags.

- **Dynamic Background Images** : One of the standout features of Iris is our dynamic background images, which feature stunning visuals, providing you a beautiful and inspiring backdrop for your searches. They provide an immersive for users, making their searches more engaging. Many people spend a significant amount of time searching the web, so having a beautiful and inspiring backdrop can make the experience more enjoyable. By providing stunning dynamic background images, Iris creates a positive environment for users, which can help to boost their mood and productivity while searching the web.
